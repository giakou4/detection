# Object Detection

Simple [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) for object detection models. Datasets are downlaoded from [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/).
Models included are:
1. YOLOv3 and YOLOv4 in original [Darknet](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) (C implementation)
2. YOLOv3 by [Ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3) (PyTorch backbone)
3. YOLOv5 by [Ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) (PyTorch backbone)
4. YOLOv7 by [Chien-Yao Wang](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7) (PyTorch backbone)
5. Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, FCOS, RetinaNet, RPN, Mask R-CNN by [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) in [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2) framework (PyTorch backbone)
